					<h1>Applying to Neahtid</h1>
					<p>Ready to apply for an internship or a full-time job at Neahtid? Here’s what you’ll need:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>An updated resume</li>
						<li>A transcript from your university (unofficial is fine)</li>
						<li>A cover letter, short essay, or additional information is optional</li>
					</ul>
					<!--h2>Focus on your resume</h2>
					<p>Your resume is the first piece of information we’ll see about you. Here’s how to highlight your achievements:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Align your skills and experience with the internship or job description</li>
						<li>Be specific about projects you’ve worked on or managed. What was the outcome? How did you measure success?</li>
						<li>If you’ve had a leadership role in a volunteer organization or at a part-time job, tell us about it. How big was the team? What was the scope of your work?</li>
						<li>Include your GPA, as well as school-related projects or coursework that demonstrate relevant skills and knowledge</li>
						<li>Keep it short: Aim for one page. If there’s additional information we need during the hiring process, (like a portfolio), your recruiter will work with you to collect it</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Prepare for the interview process</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Next step is a series of interviews—which may be on the phone, via video conference, or in person</li>
						<li>Structure your interview answers: It’s important to show how you arrive at a solution, so think out loud</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Helpful questions to think about as you prepare:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>How do you work best, both as an individual and as part of a team?</li>
						<li>What challenges have you faced at school or at work and how did you overcome them?</li>
						<li>Which of your skills or experiences would be assets in the role and why?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If you don’t understand a question, ask your interviewers for clarification and take the time you need with responses.</p-->
